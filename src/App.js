//Son of Murugesan, brother of Haresh, wife of TBD. Rakesh embodies what it means to enjoy life to fullest while still pursuing excellence in academics and healing the world. I‚Äôm proud to know Rakesh and am beyond honored to be a friend of his and beyond blessed to see him succeed in life. Hope to see an Anirudh concert with him soon. 2/10

  { text: "Rakesh is a pillar of the Tamil community, changing the lives of one individual at a time. Unfortunately it comes at the cost of his mental health and aura which he has failed to consider and will pay for dearly. As a result he may be cooked in some aspects of his life, yet nevertheless maintains a fun and positive outlook on life given his shortcomings as an individual. Furthermore he has excelled in both physical and academic aspects of his life, efforts of which have been proven to be futile in securing the level of happiness he hopes to one day achieve. The one commendable quality about Rakesh is that he uplifts and motivates his friends to be better, and lives as an example to us all of how much hard work combined with talent can achieve. He is a bundle of joy.", name: "Sanyog", desc: "Friend" },
  { text: "Rakesh is a one of a kind individual who carries various intrinsic qualities such as fashion, passion, and power. He has a knack for aura farming with a cheeky sense of style built for both the male and female gaze. Additionally, he has successfully fended off numerous threats to society (serial killers, bank robbers, and mad scientists) as the Indian Detective. However, while Rakesh excels in several aspects of life, he unfortunately has yet to secure a future partnership with a potential loved one. His previous attempts have proven futile, so changes must be made for the betterment of his future. Perhaps he can shift his focus from lifting weights to procuring dates instead. Either way, I hope to continue to monitor his relationship status. Overall, Rakesh possesses excellent build quality with premium materials. His friendship is everlasting and impossible to replace. Would highly recommend üëç", name: "Kunal", desc: "Friend" },

  { text: "One might simply know Rakesh, but only those who truly who understand him know that he is a magician. His most well known trick is a disappearing act of wondrous proportions. First, he makes his Power of Rizz known: his muscular physique, his academic prowess, and most famously, his shirtless dancing skills to This Is America. And when the women are drawn to him, when they covet his hand in marriage‚Ä¶ he makes it all DISAPPEAR in a flash, showing himself as a driveling Homunculus, closer to the Neanderthal species than his Sapien brethren. His second trick is one of conjuring. He begins by simply rhyming nonsensical words to a statement someone has already made, and alas, the trick is over before it has even begun! He has CONJURED pity laughter from the commoners around him. Truly worth every penny (free). 10/10.", name: "Anagh", desc: "Former-Roommate and Friend" },
  { text: "The prestigious University of Pennsylvania is home to some the greatest minds, more specifically, their medical school that hosts amazing talents from around the world and Rakesh. Today I will be critically breaking down my thoughts on this man. He has struggled with the ladies at times. He has recently discovered how to cook. He really struggles at sports not like tennis. Unfortunately those are the only bad things I can say about him. The passion that exudes from his temples (other than the copious amounts of sweat) are only matched by the lust he has for knowledge and his thirst quenching journey to doctorhood. For the passion, I must say he inspires me to rate him a 9/10", name: "Sri", desc: "Humble-er" },
  { text: "Rakesh has come a long way since the days of McGhee, or even the Doc. At first he looked like the type of guy that would choose a 918 over a LaFerrari (oh wait he is that guy), however throughout the years he has gained a cheekiness and aura that have placed him firmly in the (name one) category. Unfortunately this has not yet helped him in a few key ways that other reviewers have mentioned, but it is undeniable that he has ascended to a higher status, and he will no doubt continue ascending. He remains an inspiration to us all and a great friend and man. 9.18/10", name: "Santhusht", desc: "Life-Bro" },
  { text: "Rakesh, more widely known as Rak, keesh, frick, b8, copper, or brother, is a specimen that ought be inspected. Rak is primarily known for his physical prowess, such as when he overextended his obliques during isometric exercises. He shines a light forward for his friends, setting a strong example. Unfortunately, he often shines in the wrong direction, making a fool of himself and his brethren. Despite this, he has redeeming qualities. The diversity of his thoughts- from his views on dating abstinence to his academic pursuits in neurosurgery impress us greatly. Moreover, he is a consistent friend and family man. Ultimately, he is accepted and cherished by his friends, which yields his final rating of a 8/10", name: "Sahil", desc: "Friend" },

            Happy birthday Anna! I hope this birthday will be exciting and awesome as usual. I always have so much compliments for you at all times but its always for a reason. I always see you as some who is able to take the best parts of Dad and the best parts of Ma in one. Hanging out with you is like hanging out with both Ma and Dad. Your slow and detailed thinking always inspires me to analyze any situation I am in and your advice always gives me the confidence to handle them. I am so happy everyday with the person I have became today but you have always maintained an equal share with Mom and Dad in shaping me properly and continue to! The world has so many successful people but you will always be THE ONE with the most mass of them all! <br /><br />
